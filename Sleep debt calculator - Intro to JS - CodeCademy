//Sleep debt calculator//

//My solo attempt//

/*calculate if youâ€™re getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.*/

/* determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week.*/

/*Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you are from your weekly sleep goal.*/

//How much sleep did I get?//

let mondayNight = 9;
let tuesdayNight = 8;
let wednesdayNight = 9;
let thursdayNight = 6;
let fridayNight = 5;
let saturdayNight = 5;
let sundayNight = 4;

let actualWeek = mondayNight + tuesdayNight + wednesdayNight + thursdayNight + fridayNight + saturdayNight + sundayNight;

//How much sleep would I like?//
let idealSleep = 9;
let sleepTarget = 7 * idealSleep;

//Do I have a sleep debt?//
const debt = actualWeek - sleepTarget;

console.log(`Your sleep debt balance for the week is ${debt}.`);


//Following CodeCademy's advice//
